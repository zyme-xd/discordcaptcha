A Captcha verification bot based on Discord.js.

## Setup procedure
DiscordCaptcha requires NodeJS 8.0+. Install it <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/">here</a>.<br />
To install all required NPM-Modules, run the install script in `~/setup/` (.sh or .bat file depends on your operating system) (or `npm install` <b>in bots' directory</b> if both don't work.) (Click <a href="https://discordjs.guide/#/preparations/?id=installing-nodejs">here</a> for a detailed installation tutorial on how to install nodejs)<br/><br/>

For now, make sure the bot is only in one guild.

The config file is located in `~/src/`. Get your Token from <a href="https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me">here</a>.

## Additional commands

```js
/**
* Snowflake: ID
* Mention: A basic mention (looks like <@123456789>)
**/
!block <Snowflake | Mention> // Blocks a User ID. If the User sends a message to the guild, he'll get kicked.
!removeBlock <Snowflake | Mention> // Removes a User ID from the blacklist. User can write again without getting kicked.
!clear <Amount of messages> // Clears an amount of messages, up to 100
!version // The current version and the latest version
!create-role // Creates the verification role
```

## Adding captchas
You can add as many captchas as you want into the `~/captchas/` directory, but please keep in mind that:
- Extension has to be .png
- Filename **has** to be the same as the captcha.

!api queries // Current query
!api querydelete // Deletes the query (should be executed every 2 or 3 weeks)
